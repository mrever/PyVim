# Vython
Use Vim as a Python shell--like Jupyter but it's in Vim.

Features:

-Executes Python files, individual lines, or blocks (via visual mode) within the Vim editor

-Displays the output in a separate buffer/window

-Can inspect variable/expression values

-Set breakpoints within functions etc. and inspect local variables

-Completions (via rlcompleter, or IPython if available)



Requirements:

-Vim (gVim, neovim, Oni) with Python3 build (Python2 not supported, nor will it be)


Demo/tutorial is in the works.
